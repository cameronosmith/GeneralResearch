smaller error when using subset of nodes.
perhaps will invert when using larger resevoir.

need to scale the data much better 

config working
esn = pyESN.ESN(  n_inputs  = train_in.shape[1],
                  n_outputs = train_out_truth.shape[1],
                  n_reservoir = 100,
                  spectral_radius = .9,
                  noise = .001,
                  sparsity = .42,
                  random_state = 42 )
